                            <em>The Unknowable</em> represents a unfettered exploration of form,<br>
                            interweaving dancers and vocalists in conversation and as extensions of the Self.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Unknowable follows a young woman and her journey to sincere intellectual and 
                            emotional curiosity. In considering the form of operatic ballet, Rossen explains: 
                            "Throughout history, ballet in opera has been treated as episodic and disjunct 
                            from the larger narrative – as a brief visual delight. The form of ‘operatic ballet’ 
                            found in The Unknowable interweaves dancers and vocalists like never before. This 
                            story explores how artists can communicate and understand one another not only with 
                            words, but also with kinesics and haptics. Empathy, frustration, compassion, and 
                            inquisitiveness mysteriously blossom in this multi-sensorial experience.” The 
                            Unknowable takes the bravura singing of opera and the highly refined movement of 
                            ballet–and makes it real.

                        <p>
                            Through the integration of original compositions with the vibrant song cycles
                            of Hector Berlioz and Gustav Mahler, <em>The Unknowable</em> offers audiences
                            a transformative journey through sound and motion, questioning what can truly
                            be known about ourselves and our choices.

                                <p class="act-description">
                                    <em>The Unknowable</em> centers around the talented and ambitious Edna
                                    as she attends a dinner party hosted by her parents. Throughout the evening, guests press
                                    her to spend an upcoming vacation in various ways: her mother encourages her to network and
                                    further her career, while her sisters want her to travel abroad.
                                </p>
                                <p class="act-description">
                                    As the dinner unfolds with percussive, witty conversation rife with intellectual jokes
                                    and references, the partygoers listen to opera music on a "Bluetooth speaker"—Hector Berlioz's
                                    <em>Les nuits d'été</em> ("Summer Nights") sung by professional vocalist Edith Brookenberg. Edna becomes enthralled
                                    by the music, dancing to the vocals until she finds a dance partner in Hannah, her mother's college friend.
                                </p>
                                <p class="act-description">
                                    Overwhelmed by familial pressure and the weight of expectation, Edna dissociates from
                                    the party in a <em>Nutcracker</em>-esque twist, entering a transcendental dream world.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h4 class="act-title">Act II: No Ostentatious Verbiage, Just Melody</h4>
                                <p class="act-description">
                                    Edna and Hannah embark on a metaphysical journey through unbridled joy and internal strife.
                                    Five dreamy apparitions appear and dance with them, whose
                                    movements are exalting and yearning. Another professional singer, Anna Reminwake, sings Gustav Mahler's
                                    <em>Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen</em> ("Songs of a Wayfarer") as the lines
                                    between reality and fantasy blur.
                                </p>
                                <p class="act-description">
                                    In a pivotal moment, the two primary dancers are imbued with voices—Edna with Edith
                                    and Hannah with Anna. Four characters become two. The lines between sound and
                                    movement dissolve in a manner that intensifies the work's larger themes of identity,
                                    reality, and transcendence.
                                </p>
                                <p class="act-description">
                                    During her experience in the dream world, Edna sings along with Hannah: <em>"Let us
                                    build us a city! Let us build us a tower! With that unalloyed confidence, we close
                                    the world."</em> This allusion to the Tower of Babel–this extended metaphor of faux 
                                    omnipotence–reflects society's expectation to achieve something immeasurable, something 
                                    that will change the world. Yet Edna emerges from the dream no closer to clarity than 
                                    when she entered, ultimately realizing that she may not even want to obtain that 
                                    power. Perhaps, there's something else that will enrich her life and fulfill her.
                                </p>

                        <p class="music-card-description">
                            Berlioz's revolutionary orchestral song cycle—one of the first of its kind—forms the
                            heart of Act I. Setting Théophile Gautier's poetry, these "Summer Nights" achieve
                            what opera singer Susan Graham describes as “microscopic in its detail and so intimate that it feels 
                            like you’re telling secrets.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="music-card-description">
                            The work's structure of four somber songs framed by exuberant opening and closing ones mirrors
                            the emotional arc of <em>The Unknowable</em>. Its theme of love unrequited or lost
                            becomes the sonic backdrop for Edna's dissociation and her ache for vanished 
                            or unattainable "beauty."

                        <p class="music-card-composer">Gustav Mahler (1884-85)</p>
                        <p class="music-card-description">
                            Written after Mahler's unhappy love affair for theatre singer Johanna Richter, these "Songs of a
                            Wayfarer" (or more literally, "Songs of a Journeyman") trace the path from heartbreak
                            to tentative peace. The title itself held autobiographical meaning. As a young conductor
                            traveling town to town, Mahler was himself between apprentice and master.
                        </p>
                        <p class="music-card-description">
                            The cycle is characterized by progressive tonality, where each song ends in a different key than it began.
                            This underscores wayfarer's journey across emotional landscapes. The contrast between nature's beauty
                            and the human heart's despair, a hallmark of German Romanticism, translates into physical movement
                            in Act II's transcendental dream world.

                    <h3>The Listening Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        As Benjamin T. Rossen explains: "The Unknowable centers around the listening experience of
                        'Les nuits d'été' by Hector Berlioz and 'Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen' by Gustav Mahler.
                        These song cycles were carefully chosen for their rich soundworlds and allegories to embody
                        the characters' personal journeys and burgeoning curiosity."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rossen's original compositions seamlessly weave through these masterworks, creating bridges
                        between the 19th-century Romantic tradition and contemporary musical language. The result is
                        a unified whole: a true cycle in the spirit of both Berlioz and Mahler, where the lines between
                        sound and movement dissolve entirely.
